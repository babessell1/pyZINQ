Recent studies have leveraged these catalogs to show that STRs play a widespread role in regulating gene expression and other molecular phenotypes. These analyses suggest that STRs are an underappreciated but rich reservoir of variation that likely make significant contributions to Mendelian diseases, complex traits, and cancer.},

            Microsatellite instability (MSI) refers to the hypermutability of short repetitive sequences in the genome caused by impaired DNA mismatch repair. Although MSI has been studied for decades, large amounts of sequencing data now available allows us to examine the molecular fingerprints of MSI in greater detail. Here, we analyse ∼8,000 exomes and ∼1,000 whole genomes of cancer patients across 23 cancer types. Our analysis reveals that the frequency of MSI events is highly variable within and across tumour types. We also identify genes in DNA repair and oncogenic pathways recurrently subject to MSI and uncover non-coding loci that frequently display MSI. Finally, we propose a highly accurate exome-based predictive model for the MSI phenotype. These results advance our understanding of the genomic drivers and consequences of MSI, and our comprehensive catalogue of tumour-type-specific MSI loci will enable panel-based MSI testing to identify patients who are likely to benefit from immunotherapy.},

              Expansions of short tandem repeats (STRs) cause many rare diseases. Expansion detection is challenging with short-read DNA sequencing data since supporting reads are often mapped incorrectly. Detection is particularly difficult for “novel” STRs, which include new motifs at known loci or STRs absent from the reference genome. We developed STRling to efficiently count k-mers to recover informative reads and call expansions at known and novel STR loci. STRling is sensitive to known STR disease loci, has a low false discovery rate, and resolves novel STR expansions to base-pair position accuracy. It is fast, scalable, open-source, and available at:

	abstract = {Identifying large expansions of short tandem repeats (STRs), such as those that cause amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and fragile X syndrome, is challenging for short-read whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data. A solution to this problem is an important step toward integrating WGS into precision medicine. We developed a software tool called ExpansionHunter that, using PCR-free WGS short-read data, can genotype repeats at the locus of interest, even if the expanded repeat is larger than the read length. We applied our algorithm to WGS data from 3001 ALS patients who have been tested for the presence of the
              C9orf72
              repeat expansion with repeat-primed PCR (RP-PCR). Compared against this truth data, ExpansionHunter correctly classified all (212/212, 95\% CI [0.98, 1.00]) of the expanded samples as either expansions (208) or potential expansions (4). Additionally, 99.9\% (2786/2789, 95\% CI [0.997, 1.00]) of the wild-type samples were correctly classified as wild type by this method with the remaining three samples identified as possible expansions. We further applied our algorithm to a set of 152 samples in which every sample had one of eight different pathogenic repeat expansions, including those associated with fragile X syndrome, Friedreich's ataxia, and Huntington's disease, and correctly flagged all but one of the known repeat expansions. Thus, ExpansionHunter can be used to accurately detect known pathogenic repeat expansions and provides researchers with a tool that can be used to identify new pathogenic repeat expansions.},

            Studies of the genetics of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) have largely focused on single nucleotide variants and short insertions/deletions. However, most of the disease heritability has yet to be uncovered, suggesting that there is substantial genetic risk conferred by other forms of genetic variation. There are over one million short tandem repeats (STRs) in the genome, and their link to AD risk has not been assessed. As pathogenic expansions of STR cause over 30 neurologic diseases, it is important to ascertain whether STRs may also be implicated in AD risk. Here, we genotyped 321,742 polymorphic STR tracts genome-wide using PCR-free whole genome sequencing data from 2,981 individuals (1,489 AD case and 1,492 control individuals). We implemented an approach to identify STR expansions as STRs with tract lengths that are outliers from the population. We then tested for differences in aggregate burden of expansions in case versus control individuals. AD patients had a 1.19-fold increase of STR expansions compared to healthy elderly controls (p=8.27×10
            −3
            , two-sided Mann Whitney test). Individuals carrying {\textgreater} 30 STR expansions had 3.62-fold higher odds of having AD and had more severe AD neuropathology. AD STR expansions were highly enriched within active promoters in post-mortem hippocampal brain tissues and particularly within SINE-VNTR-Alu (SVA) retrotransposons. Together, these results demonstrate that expanded STRs within active promoter regions of the genome promote risk of AD.},

            Repeat expansions are responsible for over 40 monogenic disorders, and undoubtedly more pathogenic repeat expansions remain to be discovered.

Recent discoveries emphasize the need for methods that do not require pre-specified candidate repeats. To address this need, we introduce ExpansionHunter Denovo, an efficient catalog-free method for genome-wide repeat expansion detection. Analysis of real and simulated data shows that our method can identify large expansions of 41 out of 44 pathogenic repeats, including nine recently reported non-reference repeat expansions not discoverable via existing methods.},

              Background
              Identification of bacterial taxa associated with diseases, exposures, and other variables of interest offers a more comprehensive understanding of the role of microbes in many conditions. However, despite considerable research in statistical methods for association testing with microbiome data, approaches that are generally applicable remain elusive. Classical tests often do not accommodate the realities of microbiome data, leading to power loss. Approaches tailored for microbiome data depend highly upon the normalization strategies used to handle differential read depth and other data characteristics, and they often have unacceptably high false positive rates, generally due to unsatisfied distributional assumptions. On the other hand, many non-parametric tests suffer from loss of power and may also present difficulties in adjusting for potential covariates. Most extant approaches also fail in the presence of heterogeneous effects. The field needs new non-parametric approaches that are tailored to microbiome data, robust to distributional assumptions, and powerful under heterogeneous effects, while permitting adjustment for covariates.
            
            
              Methods
              As an alternative to existing approaches, we propose a zero-inflated quantile approach (ZINQ), which uses a two-part quantile regression model to accommodate the zero inflation in microbiome data. For a given taxon, ZINQ consists of a valid test in logistic regression to model the zero counts, followed by a series of quantile rank-score based tests on multiple quantiles of the non-zero part with adjustment for the zero inflation. As a regression and quantile-based approach, the method is non-parametric and robust to irregular distributions, while providing an allowance for covariate adjustment. Since no distributional assumptions are made, ZINQ can be applied to data that has been processed under any normalization strategy.
            
            
              Results
              Thorough simulations based on real data across a range of scenarios and application to real data sets show that ZINQ often has equivalent or higher power compared to existing tests even as it offers better control of false positives.
            
            
              Conclusions
              We present ZINQ, a quantile-based association test between microbiota and dichotomous or quantitative clinical variables, providing a powerful and robust alternative for the current microbiome differential abundance analysis.},
